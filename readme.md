# Compression App

## 🎮 About the Project
I implemented a web application with an HTML `form` that allows users to select a file, choose a compression type (e.g., ZIP or GZIP), and compress it. This app streamlines the process of file compression directly in the browser using backend functionality.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (Used for handling the file compression logic and server-side functionality)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For ensuring code quality and consistency  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing the compression functions and form validation  

## 📌 Features
✅ Allows users to select a file and choose a compression type  
✅ Supports compressing files in different formats (ZIP, GZIP)  
✅ Includes a simple, user-friendly form interface for easy use  

## 🌐 Demo
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and use the compression app to compress your files in various formats.
